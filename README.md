# Countries

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/patloew/countries.svg?branch=java)](https://travis-ci.org/patloew/countries)

A sample Android app, which lists all countries with some additional information (currencies, languages, …). The app uses the MVVM pattern with the [Android data binding lib](http://developer.android.com/tools/data-binding/guide.html). Countries can be bookmarked and are then stored locally with [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-java). [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) is used to fetch the country information from the free [REST Countries](http://restcountries.eu) service. For JSON parsing, custom [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) TypeAdapters are used. [Parceler](https://github.com/johncarl81/parceler) is used to make the Country objects Parcelable. Also, [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger) is used for dependency injection.

The purpose of this is app is to show how:
* [the MVVM architectural pattern can be used with the data binding library](https://nullpointer.wtf/android/mvvm-architecture-data-binding-library/)
* [Retrofit, Realm, Parceler and Gson with custom TypeAdapters work together](https://nullpointer.wtf/android/using-retrofit-realm-parceler/)
* Dagger 2 can be used with different Scopes

This project can also be used as a template for new apps. Check out the template branch for a cleaned up version of this project.

For the same example app (and template) written in Kotlin, you can check out the kotlin branches.
